var_1= input("please enter a number")                  # the value we enter will be converted to a string

if(  int(var_1) > 100):                           # as var_1 is of String type so we need to typecast it to Int
    print("number is greate then 20")            # then only it can be used in this if statement
else:
    print("number is smaller then 20")

# with (:) colon the body starts, as we have curly braces in java
